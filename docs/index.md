# Binski Guide


## Getting started

[A tutorial](tutorial.md) will lead step-by-step into the creation of your first binksi game.

## How to use the editor

The usage of the editor should be transparent if you're already familiar with bipsi. You can check the [bipsi user guide](https://kool.tools/bipsi/user-guide.pdf) if you're lost.

To take better advantage of binksi, you will need to write an Ink story in the ink tab. If you need help, you can follow the documentation at [Writing With Ink](https://github.com/inkle/ink/blob/master/Documentation/WritingWithInk.md). 

The editor comes preloaded with an example story. You can find [the example file in the repository](https://github.com/smwhr/binksi/blob/main/data/story.ink).


## Binksi specifics

Binksi comes preloaded with [additional syntax and shortcuts](binksi-syntax.md) to help you take advantage of all bipsi functionalities on the ink side and expose all ink functionnalities on the bipsi side.


## About and thanks

Binksi is a pure fork of [bipsi](https://kool.tools/bipsi/) and retains 98% of the original code.  
If you do not need a complex narrative or dialog based component in your game, I strongly advise you to use the original ! They should be compatible and you can always import it later.

I am [smwhr](https://smwhr.itch.io/) and you can read about me on my [personal website](https://smwhr.net).

Many thanks to [PRINCESS INTERNET CAFé](https://princessinternetcafe.itch.io/) who wrote the tutorial and thoroughly tested binksi and suggested many changes.
