# hidden features of bipsi

## multiple save files

you can have multiple browser saves in bipsi, but there's no user interface. to use another save, change the browser url to a `save` query parameter e.g `https://kool.tools/bipsi/?save=savename`. by default bipsi uses a save named `slot0`

## hd mode

bipsi supports an hd mode where tiles are 16 x 16 pixels instead of the usual 8 x 8 pixels, but there's no user interface to switch into it. there is no mechanism to switch a project between hd and not hd. to switch the editor to hd mode, change the browser url to `https://kool.tools/bipsi/?hd=true`. hd mode uses independent save slots
