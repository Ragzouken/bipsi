# hidden features of bipsi

## multiple save files

you can have multiple browser saves in bipsi, but there's no user interface. to use another save, change the browser url to a `save` query parameter e.g `https://kool.tools/bipsi/?save=savename`. by default bipsi uses a save named `slot0`

## hd mode

bipsi supports an hd mode where tiles are 16 x 16 pixels instead of the usual 8 x 8 pixels, but there's no user interface to switch into it. there is no mechanism to switch a project between hd and not hd. to switch the editor to hd mode, change the browser url to `https://kool.tools/bipsi/?hd=true`. hd mode uses independent save slots 

## extra animation frames

bipsi knows how to playback tiles with more than two animation frames, but the
editor doesn't support them. you can manipulate the gamedata yourself to achieve
this, just be aware the editor may accidentally remove extra frames
